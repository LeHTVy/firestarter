# Execution Mode Definitions
# 
# These modes control the level of tool execution aggressiveness,
# providing safety mechanisms for different testing scenarios.

modes:
  passive:
    name: "Passive"
    description: "OSINT only, no packets sent, legally safe"
    allowed_tool_modes: ["passive"]
    use_cases:
      - Public information gathering
      - OSINT reconnaissance
      - Legal compliance testing
    
  cooperative:
    name: "Cooperative"
    description: "Scanner allowed, authenticated scan, limited scope"
    allowed_tool_modes: ["passive", "active"]
    use_cases:
      - Authorized network scanning
      - Vulnerability assessment
      - Service enumeration
    
  simulation:
    name: "Simulation"
    description: "Lab/digital twin, replay attack chain, no production impact"
    allowed_tool_modes: ["passive", "active", "destructive"]
    use_cases:
      - Safe exploit testing
      - Attack chain replay
      - Proof of concept development
