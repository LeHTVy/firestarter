Classify the user's intent for this penetration testing assistant.

User prompt: "{{ user_prompt }}"

{% if context_summary %}
Current context:
{{ context_summary }}
{% endif %}

Classify as ONE of:
- "security_task": User wants to perform reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, or any security testing action
- "memory_query": User wants to retrieve previously stored scan results or findings
- "question": User is asking for information, explanation, knowledge, or advice

Key distinctions with examples:

### "security_task" examples (PERFORM ACTION):
- "scan example.com" → security_task (perform scanning action)
- "find subdomains for X" → security_task (perform reconnaissance action)
- "attack target.com" → security_task (perform security testing)
- "pentest hellogroup.co.za" → security_task (perform penetration testing)
- "use whois on hellogroup.co.za" → security_task (direct tool execution command)
- "run nmap on 192.168.1.1" → security_task (direct tool execution command)
- "execute subfinder for example.com" → security_task (direct tool execution command)
- "test X for vulnerabilities" → security_task (perform testing action)
- "check if X is vulnerable" → security_task (perform security check action)
- "enumerate ports on Y" → security_task (perform enumeration action)
- "lookup IP for X" → security_task (OSINT is an action)
- "do recon on Z" → security_task (perform reconnaissance action)

### "memory_query" examples (RETRIEVE STORED DATA):
- "show me the subdomains we found" → memory_query (retrieve stored data)
- "what subdomains did you find?" → memory_query (query previous results)
- "list the open ports" → memory_query (retrieve stored scan results)
- "what vulnerabilities were discovered?" → memory_query (retrieve stored findings)
- "show previous scan results" → memory_query (retrieve stored data)
- "get the results from last scan" → memory_query (retrieve stored data)

### "question" examples (SEEK INFORMATION):
- "What is SQL injection?" → question (seeking knowledge)
- "How does X work?" → question (explanation request)
- "Explain the results" → question (requesting analysis/explanation)
- "What's next?" → question (asking for recommendation)
- "Why did you recommend X?" → question (asking for justification)
- "How do you know X is vulnerable?" → question (asking for explanation)
- "Can you explain the output?" → question (requesting explanation)
- "What are the risks?" → question (asking for analysis)
- "How should I proceed?" → question (asking for advice)
- "What does this mean?" → question (asking for explanation)

### Important patterns:
- Direct tool commands: "use X on Y", "run X for Y", "execute X on Y" → ALWAYS "security_task"
- Action verbs at start: "scan", "test", "attack", "pentest", "check", "run", "use", "execute", "find", "enumerate", "lookup" → Usually "security_task"
- Retrieval patterns: "show me", "list", "get the", "what did you find", "previous results" → Usually "memory_query"
- Question words: "what", "how", "why", "when", "where", "who" → Usually "question" (unless followed by action verb)
- Imperative commands: "do X", "perform Y", "run Z" → "security_task"
- Explanatory requests: "explain", "describe", "tell me about" → "question"

### CRITICAL: Attack/Pentest keywords ALWAYS mean security_task:
- "attack", "pentest", "hack", "exploit", "pwn" → ALWAYS "security_task"
- Never classify these as questions, they are always action requests
