Classify the user's intent for this penetration testing agent.

User prompt: "{{ user_prompt }}"

Classify as ONE of:
- "question": User is asking for information, explanation, knowledge, or advice
- "request": User is requesting an action to be performed (reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, tool execution)

Key distinctions with examples:

"question" examples:
- "What is SQL injection?" → question (seeking knowledge)
- "How does X work?" → question (explanation request)
- "Explain the results" → question (requesting analysis/explanation)
- "What's next?" → question (asking for recommendation)
- "Why did you recommend X?" → question (asking for justification)
- "How do you know X is vulnerable?" → question (asking for explanation)
- "Can you explain the output?" → question (requesting explanation)
- "What are the risks?" → question (asking for analysis)

"request" examples:
- "scan example.com" → request (perform scanning action)
- "assess hellogroup.co.za" → request (perform assessment action)
- "attack target.com" → request (perform security testing)
- "use whois on hellogroup.co.za" → request (direct tool execution command)
- "run nmap on 192.168.1.1" → request (direct tool execution command)
- "execute subfinder for example.com" → request (direct tool execution command)
- "find subdomains for X" → request (perform reconnaissance action)
- "test X for vulnerabilities" → request (perform testing action)
- "check if X is vulnerable" → request (perform security check action)
- "enumerate ports on Y" → request (perform enumeration action)
- "perform recon on Z" → request (perform reconnaissance action)

Important patterns:
- Direct tool commands: "use X on Y", "run X for Y", "execute X on Y" → ALWAYS "request"
- Action verbs at start: "scan", "test", "assess", "attack", "check", "run", "use", "execute" → Usually "request"
- Question words: "what", "how", "why", "when", "where", "who" → Usually "question" (unless followed by action verb)
- Imperative commands: "do X", "perform Y", "run Z" → "request"
- Explanatory requests: "explain", "describe", "tell me about" → "question"

Return your classification in JSON format:
```json
{
  "intent": "question|request",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this classification was chosen, referencing the examples above"
}
```
